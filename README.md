# Schlage_D145
Print a custom D145 Schlage key

Best results have been printing the key flat. Have required very minimal clean up, usually just running it through the cylinder a few times clears out any hangers.

The SCAD file requires the STL file as I have no idea how to import or merge it.

This is provided with no guarantee as I have almost no experience 3D modeling and for educational use only.

Do not use printed keys on locks that are in use, they can break or shatter and cause permanent damage.
